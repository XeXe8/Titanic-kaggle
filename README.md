Titanic Kaggle Project
This repository contains my solution for the Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster competition on Kaggle.

Introduction
The Titanic dataset is a classic machine learning problem where the goal is to predict the survival outcome of passengers aboard the Titanic based on various features such as age, gender, ticket class, etc. This project aims to build machine learning models to predict whether a passenger survived or not.

Dataset
The dataset contains the following files:

train.csv: Training set containing features and labels.
test.csv: Test set containing features.
gender_submission.csv: Sample submission file containing the format for submission to Kaggle.
